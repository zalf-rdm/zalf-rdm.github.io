# Data Publication

The publication of research is a central issue in science. Beside traditional scientific papers, data publication became more important in the past years. Research data are stored and published by data journals, central (thematic) data repositories or in open databases (e.g., university). To provide proper findability, reusability and citeability of these data, (persistent) identifiers are necessary, e.g. to assign data sets or authors to research. Most significant is the:

DataCite, DOI  
The DOI system became the standard for information and documentation (ISO 26324:2012)    . In the DOI system the object is identified unambiguously to its institution (prefix). There is no limit of the length of either suffix or prefix. For example, all DOI, which are provided by BonaRes Data Centre, have the prefix: 10.20387. Metadata can be associated with the object. 

Persistent identifier (PI) 
Persistent individual digital identifiers for authors and researchers can be used as name lists for creator and contributor names e.g. in DataCite. Examples are:
ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID), Scopus (Elsevier), Publons (Clarivate Analytics, Thomas Reuters), LinkedIN, ResearchGate, ISNI (ISO 27729:2012 International Standard Name Identifier) and the Handle system. The last was implemented into the digital object identifier (DOI), specified by the US-standard ANSI/NISO Z39.84-2005 and managed by the DOI Foundation. Further PIs are Persistent URL (PURL), Uniform Resource Name (URN), Archival Resource Keys (ARK), and Extensible Resource Identifier (XRI). More information is given by Juha Hakala, 2010.

Taxonomies for author contributions to science
CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy)
This taxonomy aims to provide transparency to the contributions of researchers to published work, to enable discoverability and to improve attribution, credit, and accountability. There are 14 categories defined for author’s contribution.
 
IGSN (International Geo Sample Number)
Alphanumeric code to provide transparency to the contributions of researchers to scholarly published work, to enable discoverability and to improve attribution, credit, and accountability.


Data journals and publication portals (selected overview):
A review of efficient and enhanced publishing, dissemination, sharing and reuse of bio-diversity data are given by Chavan and Penev (2011). Data publication in data journals are classified as “pure” publish data papers only and journals classified as “mixed” publish both. 

Biodiversity Data Journal (Pensoft)
This journal is community peer-reviewed and Open-Access. It is in accordance with the Data Publishing Policies and Guidelines of Pensoft Publishers. Important standards for this Journal: related data must have DOI or other persistent identifier, XML.

International, interdisciplinary journal for the publication of articles on original research data (sets). Important standards for this Journal: Dataset with persistent identifier; OAI-PMH; Metadata in Dublin Core format (oai-dc), full-text XML.

Ecological Archives / Data Papers: (Ecologigal Society of America, ESA)
Provides and hosts supplemental material to ESA articles. Data is registered in official Data Registry of the ESA. Data are fully peer reviewed, technical review of data and metadata. Data ingest as text format. Important standards for this Journal: Metadata following (Michener et al., 1997).

F1000 Research (F1000 Research Ltd, Science Navigation Group)
Data articles are citable and authors are credited when data are reused. Important standards for this Journal: CC0, no explicit standards but guidelines for different datasets, metadata of date linked to the journal should be, when possible, in standardized machine readable formats (DataCite).
Mostly DataCite as well as DOI were important standards used in these Journals. The most important Persistent Identifier (PI) used is the DOI.

Data repositories (selected overview)
There are numerous repositories for research data, provided by the private or public domain. Objective of all repositories is to store, archive, manage and/or provide data to the scientific community, scientists and/or institutions. An overview and recommendations of over 2,000 repositories available are published by re3data.org (full scale resource of registered repositories across subject areas).

B2FIND

Scholix (Scholarly Link eXchange)
This initiative links and connects data and metadata. It aims to establish an interoperability framework information exchange between literature and data and to set-up an open information framework to describe and understand what data underpins literature and what literature references data. 


Conflicts and solutions
While the expression of DOI as URN is possible, conversions from DOI into other systems, such as XRI or ARK, are difficult or impossible, respectively. In contrast to URN, DOI goes beyond identifying an electronic manifestation of a resource. The DOI-prefix also identifies the location of access.
