# Data Publication

The publication of research is a central issue in science. Beside traditional scientific papers, data publication became
more important in the past years. Research data are stored and published by data journals, central (thematic) data
repositories or in open databases (e.g., university). To provide proper findability, reusability and citeability of these data,
(persistent) identifiers are necessary, e.g. to assign data sets or authors to research. Most significant is the:

<br>

### DataCite, DOI  

The DOI system became the standard for information and documentation **(ISO 26324:2012)**. In the DOI system the object is
identified unambiguously to its institution (prefix). There is no limit of the length of either suffix or prefix.
For example, all DOI, which are provided by BonaRes Data Centre, have the prefix: _10.20387_. Metadata can be associated with the object. 

<br>

_Persistent identifier (PI)_ 

Persistent individual digital identifiers for authors and researchers can be used as name lists for creator
and contributor names e.g. in DataCite. Examples are:

[ORCID](https://orcid.org) (Open Researcher and Contributor ID), [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/home.uri) (Elsevier), 
[Publons](https://publons.com/wos-op/) (Clarivate Analytics, Thomas Reuters), [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/),
[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net), **ISNI** (ISO 27729:2012 International Standard Name Identifier) and the 
[Handle](http://www.handle.net) system. The last was implemented into the digital object identifier (DOI),
specified by the US-standard **ANSI/NISO Z39.84-2005** and managed by the DOI Foundation. Further PIs are Persistent URL (**PURL**),
Uniform Resource Name (**URN**), Archival Resource Keys (**ARK**), and Extensible Resource Identifier (**XRI**).
More information is given by Juha Hakala, 2010 [[1]](http://www.persid.org/downloads/PI-intro-2010-09-22.pdf).

_Taxonomies for author contributions to science_

### CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy)

This taxonomy aims to provide transparency to the contributions of researchers to published work, to enable discoverability
and to improve attribution, credit, and accountability. There are 14 categories defined for author’s contribution.
 
<br>

### IGSN (International Geo Sample Number)

Alphanumeric code to provide transparency to the contributions of researchers to scholarly published work,
to enable discoverability and to improve attribution, credit, and accountability.

<br>
<br>

<br>

## Conflicts and solutions

While the expression of DOI as URN is possible, conversions from DOI into other systems, such as XRI or ARK, are difficult
or impossible, respectively. In contrast to URN, DOI goes beyond identifying an electronic manifestation of a resource.
The DOI-prefix also identifies the location of access.
