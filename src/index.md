# Data Standards for Soil- and Agricultural Research



**Authors**: Carsten Hoffmann, Sina Schulz, Einar Eberhardt, Meike Grosse, Susanne Stein, Xenia Specka, Nikolai Svoboda,
Uwe Heinrich

This living document has been produced in the framework of the German research
initiative [BonaRes](https://www.bonares.de) (Soil as a sustainable resource for the bio-economy). The third
version is published in the [BonaRes Series, 2020](https://tools.bonares.de/doi/doc/25/) with more than 600 standards, 
as relevant for the soil- and agricultural research data management. As the report is a living document, the report is
transferred to this web application to compile, discuss and recommend the latest state of data standards for 
soil and agricultural research. 

It is grouped based on three major data life stages and might act as a helpful reference
work for the soil-agricultural research data community.

1. [Data acquisition](/data_acquisition)
2. [Data management](/data_management)
3. [Data provision](/data_provision)

## Motivation

The use of open and widely accepted standards is the basis for modern (FAIR, [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18)) research data management. In this context, task of
this report is to describe, compare, review and recommend standards for the whole data life and to assist soil- and
agricultural scientists to store their research data into a data infrastructure to make them findable and accessible in
the long-term for any reuse. Missing and competitive national and international standards and potential conflicts are
stated and, based on internal and external expert knowledge, outstanding standards are highlighted and summarized to
recommendations:

!!!light Recommendation explanation
<img src="/static/img/two_star.jpg" width="60" valign="bottom" > Favored = highly recommended for application <br>
<img src="/static/img/one_star.jpg" width="60" valign="bottom" > OK = acceptable alternative but maybe requires later
transformation
!!!

In the [Appendix](appendix/index.md) the highly recommended standards as well as many code lists, glossaries and web
links are listed in tables

## The BonaRes Repository

In July 2017, the BonaRes Centre launched
the [BonaRes Repository](https://maps.bonares.de/mapapps/resources/apps/bonares/index.html?lang=en) for soil and
agricultural research data. Beside data from national research projects, the repository is open for other soil-related
data, e.g. from agricultural long-term field experiments (LTE). The BonaRes Centre provides DOI, easy access and
long-term availability for all uploaded research data. According to
the [Berlin Declaration on Open Access (2003)](https://openaccess.mpg.de/Berlin-Declaration) and the initiative
“Digitale Information” (
Alliance of Science Organizations in Germany, 2013), metadata and research data will not be subject to any restrictions
on reuse. Metadata are always available and, after a limited embargo-time, also research data are provided accessible
for the international research community. Further information is given in the BonaRes Data
Policy [[2]](https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.20387/BonaRes-RYCV-30RK).

According to the [GitHub FAIRMetrics](https://github.com/FAIRMetrics/Metrics),
the [BonaRes Repository](https://maps.bonares.de/mapapps/resources/apps/bonares/index.html?lang=en) serves all relevant
elements of FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, see [1]), and
additionally, provides legal security for sensitive data and facilitate data up- and downloads. To meet these demands
and to enhance research data reusability (FAIR Principle R 1.3), the use of relevant open community standards and data
documentation during data life is necessary. Such standards concern, beside others, the classification and description
of soils, field- and lab methods, agricultural technology, plant varieties, fertilizers, farming and agricultural
business, data quality control, ontologies, data formats, data storage and -archiving, and metadata management. All
standards which are recommended within this document are supported by the BonaRes repository. Research data which were
collected under standardized conditions, described with coherent metadata, proofed by quality tests, and stored in the
repository, will be visible, accessible and citable for any data reuse (e.g. modelling), exchange or review.

In the long term it is planned to consolidate the BonaRes Repository into international infrastructures for soil and
agricultural research data. This requires data interoperability by internationally accepted and applied standards.
Transformation tools may help to translate data from national to international valid systems and formats.
