# Data Standards for Soil- and Agricultural Research

**Authors**: Carsten Hoffmann, Sina Schulz, Einar Eberhardt, Meike Grosse, Susanne Stein, Xenia Specka, Nikolai Svoboda,

This living document has been produced in the framework of the German research
initiative [BonaRes](https://www.bonares.de) (Soil as a sustainable resource for the bio-economy). 
In this recent third version more than 600 standards, as relevant
for the soil- and agricultural research data management, are compiled, discussed and/or recommended. It is grouped based
on three major data life stages and might act as a helpful reference work for the soil-agricultural research data
community.

1. Data acquisition
2. Data management
3. Data provision

## Motivation

The use of open and widely accepted standards is the basis for
modern ([FAIR, see Wilkinson et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18)) research data management. In this
context, task of this report is to describe, compare, review and recommend standards for the whole data life and to
assist soil- and agricultural scientists to store their research data into a data infrastructure to make them findable
and accessible in the long-term for any reuse. Missing and competitive national and international standards and
potential conflicts are stated and, based on internal and external expert knowledge, outstanding standards are
highlighted and summarized to recommendations:

!!!light Recommendation explanation

<img src="/static/img/one_star.jpg" width="60" valign="bottom" > OK = acceptable alternative but maybe requires later transformation
!!!

In the [Appendix](appendix/index.md) the highly recommended standards as well as many code lists, glossaries and web links are listed in
tables

## The BonaRes Repository

In July 2017, the BonaRes Centre launched the BonaRes Repository for soil and agricultural research data. Beside data from
national research projects, the repository is open for other soil-related data, e.g. from agricultural long-term field
experiments (LTE). The BonaRes Centre provides DOI, easy access and long-term availability for all uploaded
research data. According to the Berlin Declaration on Open Access (2003) and the initiative “Digitale Information” (
Alliance of Science Organizations in Germany, 2013), metadata and research data will not be subject to any restrictions
on reuse. Metadata are always available and, after a limited embargo-time, also research data are provided accessible
for the international research community. Further information is given in the BonaRes Data
Policy ([Svoboda 2021](https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.20387/BonaRes-RYCV-30RK)).

According to the [GitHub FAIRMetrics](https://github.com/FAIRMetrics/Metrics), the BonaRes data repository serves all
relevant elements of FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, see Wilkinson et al., 2016),
and additionally, provides legal security for sensitive data and facilitate data up- and downloads. To meet these
demands and to enhance research data reusability (FAIR Principle R 1.3), the use of relevant open community standards
and data documentation during data life is necessary. Such standards concern, beside others, the classification and
description of soils, field- and lab methods, agricultural technology, plant varieties, fertilizers, farming and
agricultural business, data quality control, ontologies, data formats, data storage and -archiving, and metadata
management. All standards which are recommended within this document are supported by the BonaRes repository. Research
data which were collected under standardized conditions, described with coherent metadata, proofed by quality tests, and
stored in the repository, will be visible, accessible and citable for any data reuse (e.g. modelling), exchange or
review.

In the long term it is planned to consolidate the BonaRes Repository into international infrastructures for soil and
agricultural research data. This requires data interoperability by internationally accepted and applied standards.
Transformation tools may help to translate data from national to international valid systems and formats.
