# 1 Data Acquisition

The acquisition of soil-, crop-, agricultural machinery-, farming-, business, and other, soil- and
agricultural related research data are regulated by numerous, sometimes inconsistent, standards,
laws, guidelines and conventions. Many regulations are used only in national contexts and may require
transformation to be interoperable in international contexts.

In this chapter, standards in soil science from field and lab work (e.g. soil mapping, -classification, and
-quality), meteorology, agriculture (e.g., crops, tillage tools, field management, and fertilization),
business, and personal data (e.g., farm size, attitudes of farmers, income, and property rights) are
collected, described and evaluated.
