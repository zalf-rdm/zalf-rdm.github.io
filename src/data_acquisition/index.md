# Data acquisition

The acquisition of soil-, crop-, agricultural machinery-, farming-, business, and other, soil- and agricultural related
research data are regulated by numerous, sometimes inconsistent, standards, laws, guidelines and conventions. Many
regulations are used only in national contexts and may require transformation to be interoperable in international
contexts. 

In this chapter, standards in soil science from field and lab work (e.g. soil mapping, -classification, and
-quality), meteorology, agriculture (e.g., crops, tillage tools, field management, and fertilization), business, and
personal data (e.g., farm size, attitudes of farmers, income, and property rights) are collected, described and
evaluated.
