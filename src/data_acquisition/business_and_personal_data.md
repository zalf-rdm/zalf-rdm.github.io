# Business and Personal Data

There are different types of data describing characteristics of farming businesses and actors involved in agricultural 
activities (e.g. farmers and other land users, planners of land use, representatives of interest groups, politicians in the agricultural sector,
and consumers of agricultural products). These types of data include surveys, official and other statistics, interviews, 
workshops with experts’ judgements, focus groups, and other. They can be provided in different forms such as text, numbers, audios, or videos.
The data can be distinguished between different statuses, i.e., raw data, result data, and syntax data. 
Thus, standards vary over different data types and statuses. This chapter focus on standards for raw data from surveys, 
statistical analysis and interviews.

_Overview of existing standards_

### Business Association ADM 
#### (Arbeitskreis Deutscher Markt- und Sozialforschungsinstitute e.V.)

Represents the interests of private-sector market and social research agencies in Germany and provides [guidelines and 
quality standards](https://www.adm-ev.de/en/adm/), e.g. about telephone, online and personal surveys, about focus group discussion, qualitative interviews
and ethical standards in data collection.

### Certification and labels for organic farming 
#### (COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 2007)

In the European Union the Council Regulation No 824/2007 on organic production aims to ensure an “effective functioning
of the internal market, guaranteeing fair competition”, and “protecting consumer interests”. It lists rules e.g. for livestock production,
fertility management and soil protection.

### Demographic Standards [2016](https://www.statistischebibliothek.de/mir/receive/DEMonografie_mods_00003695)

This is a collection of Quality Reports about methods, definitions and standards for statistical information, 
including anonymization, table design, classification of professions, demographic standards, and macro and micro data statistics.

Joint recommendation by [ADM](https://www.asi-ev.org) and the German Federal Statistical Office provide survey versions. 
[GESIS](https://www.gesis.org/en/home) provides the **ZIS Version 14.00**, 2010, which is a collection of social science 
items and scales.
