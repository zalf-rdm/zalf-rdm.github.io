# Accompanying Disciplines

Beside common soil and agricultural data, accompanying data from different research fields concern the research field 
soil-agricultural science.

_Overview of existing standards_

### Land use classification

- The **CORINE Land Cover**  provides an EU-wide unique and comparable data set of land cover with 44 land use classes, 
out of which 37 classes are relevant for Germany. Mapping of the land cover and land use was performed on the basis of 
satellite remote sensing images on a scale of 1:100,000.
- The German land survey authorities provide topographic data and maps. Their contents are reported in the feature type 
catalogue of the Official Topographical Cartographic Information System (**ATKIS**) , where topographical appearances are 
classified in categories with land use information. ATKIS data are available in different scales (from 1:1,000,000 up to 1:25,000). 
Because of the higher spatial resolution, compared to e.g. CORINE Land Cover, the feature type’s catalogue comprises more 
land use classes (around 130 feature types).

### Meteorology

Meteorological raw-data are often available in time series with different temporal distributions. 
The conversion into convertible data and the supply for further processing is challenging.

- The German DIN 1319-1:1995-01ff   series defines basics in meteorological measurement techniques e.g. terms of measuring 
equipment (Parts 1 and 2) and measurement uncertainties (3 and 4).
- On international scale the EN ISO 20988:2007   provides a detailed guideline to estimate measurement uncertainties 
for meteorological data. It includes statistical operations on systematic data deviations, calibration, ring trials, drift controls,
and evaluation on variances. In particular the standard helps to evaluate and validate air quality data.
- ISO 9169:2006   defines the performance characteristics of an automatic meteorological system.
- Meteorological measurements are described in guidelines VDI 3786ff including an extensive glossary and instructions on data aggregation for archiving (1) and air temperature (3).

### Vegetation
- Phenology stages can be described by the BBCH   scale (Meier et al., 2009). The coding system was first published in 1992
by different expert groups and was than extended to all common crop types.
- The Minimum Information standard MIAPPE   is open and community driven. It defines a list of necessary attributes to describe
and to harmonize data from plant phenotyping experiments.
- The Braun-Blanquet-Scale , as part of the Relevé Method, defines approaches of vegetation survey.
- The Multi-Crop Passport Descriptors (FAO/IPGRI, version 2) are widely used as standardized lists for breeding and germplasm
data and for information exchange across crops. It is compatible with the descriptor lists used by FAO World information
and Early Warning System on plant genetic resources (PGR) and the GENESYS global portal.
