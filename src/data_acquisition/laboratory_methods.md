# Laboratory Methods

Soil data users may require basic information, such as pH and bulk density according to well
established standard methods in soil science. It is therefore recommended to collect these
parameters for each soil sample. In data repositories acknowledged coding systems for
field- and laboratory methods should be used to enhance methods documentation, data
comparability and interoperability.

_Overview of existing standards_

Soil sample pretreatment for laboratory analysis are defined by **ISO 11464:2006** and
<br> **DIN 19747:2009**. The national standard **DIN 32645:2008-11** contains
statistical approaches and calibration features for chemical analysis and describes limits of
detection and determination under statistical replication conditions. Alternative methods
on detection limits and calibration can be found within the international standard **DIN ISO
11843-1ff** series (see below). In Table 2 important standards for soil quality analysis
are listed.

### Methods of Soil Analysis (SSSA, 2017), Book Series 5 ![](/static/img/two_star.jpg)

The book series is a standard work in the US and collects lab and field methods in soil
science within five parts: Physical and Mineralogical Methods, Microbial and Biochemical
Properties, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, and Mineralogical Methods.


### Handbook of Soil Investigation ![](/static/img/two_star.jpg)

(Handbuch der Bodenuntersuchung, Blume et al., 2016)
!!!

Loose-leaf collection with relevant standards (12,195 pages, 15 folders, in German) for soil
description and investigation as well soil assessment. These standards cover the whole
range of soil investigation: selection of sampling locations, sample preparation, treatment
and transportation, extraction and fractionation techniques, analytical measurements, and
evaluation methods. Many of these standards are enshrined in German legislation. More
than 300 standards of the Handbook of Soil investigation are cited in the Federal Soil
Protection and Contaminated Sites Ordinance.
