# Soil Sampling

## Overview of existing standards

### GlobalSoilMap (Sampling depths) ![](/static/img/two_star.jpg)

The GlobalSoilMap initiative of the Digital Soil Mapping Working Group, International Union of Soil Science (IUSS),
supports generating and providing standardized soil data for the world. It sets-up an internationally accepted
specification for six sampling and modelling depths: 0−5, 5−15, 15−30, 30−60, 60−100, and 100-200 cm.


### ISO 18400-1ff ![](/static/img/two_star.jpg) 
#### Soil quality - Sampling

Standardized soil sampling methods used to be described in the ISO 10381 series which has been technically and
structurally revised and replaced by the ISO 18400-1ff series. ISO 18400 is currently in development and has, in
contrast to its precursor, a modular structure. Examples are the framework for a sampling plan (ISO 18400-101:2015),
safety aspects (ISO 18400-103:2015) and quality control/assurance (ISO 18400-106:2015).


### ISO 15903:2000 ![](/static/img/one_star.jpg)
#### Soil quality - Format for recording soil and site information

This standard regulates the format and recording of soil information, including
recommendations on sample design and -transport with the aim to “achieve a high degree
of harmonization in reporting results”.

Further definitions of field sampling methods can be found in the standard group
“Geotechnical investigation and testing“. Examples are **ISO 22475-1:2006** (Sampling of soil
and ground water), **ISO 22476-2:2005** (Sampling by hydraulic hammer), and ISO 17628:2015
(Determination of thermal conductivity). Besides soil sampling, the sampling of grains,
cereals and cereals products is described in **ISO 24333:2009**. German standards for soil
sampling are part of the Handbook of Soil Investigation (Handbuch der Bodenuntersuchung,
Blume et al., 2016). Selection of sampling locations, sample preparation, treatment and
transportation are described in this compilation (see also Chapter 0).
