# Soil Sampling

## Overview of existing standards

### GlobalSoilMap (Sampling depths) <img src="img/two_star.jpg" width="60" valign="bottom" >

The GlobalSoilMap initiative of the Digital Soil Mapping Working Group, International Union of Soil Science (IUSS),
supports generating and providing standardized soil data for the world. It sets-up an internationally accepted
specification for six sampling and modelling depths: 0−5, 5−15, 15−30, 30−60, 60−100, and 100-200 cm.

### ISO 18400-1ff, Soil quality - Sampling <img src="img/two_star.jpg" width="60" valign="bottom" >

Standardized soil sampling methods used to be described in the ISO 10381 series which has been technically and
structurally revised and replaced by the ISO 18400-1ff series. ISO 18400 is currently in development and has, in
contrast to its precursor, a modular structure. Examples are the framework for a sampling plan (ISO 18400-101:2015),
safety aspects (ISO 18400-103:2015) and quality control/assurance (ISO 18400-106:2015).
