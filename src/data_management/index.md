# Data management

The topic data management includes methodical standards to structure and quality assure research data as recorded by
standardized methods. Quality by supervised or unsupervised procedures e.g. data completeness, normal distribution,
integrity, and removal of outliers, is prerequisite for wellmaintained data storage, -exchange, -processing and
-evaluation. Descriptive data should be checked on misspellings, synonyms and inconsistencies to enable clear data
allocation and combination of different data sets.

When research data are collected, tested, described, and maybe pre-processed (e.g. pedotransferfunctions, biological
models, upscaling) data must be technically prepared to be transferred into the database. At this point internal
database management becomes relevant. Data (base) management includes e.g. rules on the data structure, languages and
formats used. These need to meet the requirements on later data applications such as archiving, evaluation, reuse, and
publishing. Research data management is widely implemented within research institutes in so-called Current Research
Information Systems (CRIS) and in national or international (inter-)disciplinary data repositories. An example for
national agricultural data management is the [PIAF](https://www.gil-net.de/Publikationen/131_26.pdf) system (**P**lanning, 
**I**nformation and **A**nalysis for **F**ield trials). An
international and interdisciplinary open data repository for the wide field of environmental science is the [PANGAEA](https://pangaea.de/).

Internationally accepted Data Management Plans (DMP) and open research data portals may help to plan, manage and publish
research data. Tools and guidelines are provided by open access platforms and repositories such as [ReDBox](https://www.redboxresearchdata.com.au/) (Australia),
[OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/), [CGIAR](https://www.cgiar.org/), [EUDAT](https://eudat.eu/), [EOSC](https://eosc-portal.eu/), and [INSPIRE](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/).

This chapter provides an overview of standards with general requirements on data quality, -structure -formats, and
â€“types as well as geographic reference systems, units and dimensions.
