# General Conventions

This chapter summarize general data conventions which should be considered during the data collection and preparation.

**_Overview of existing standards_**

In Table 6 (following page) an overview lists recommended standards with general and geographic data conventions and
requirements e.g. on geographic reference systems, units and dimensions.

### EN ISO 19156:2013 

This standard defines a conceptual schema for observations and features involved in sampling. It is used in [INSPIRE](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/) and
provides models for the exchange of information describing observation acts and their results, 
both within and between different scientific and technical communities. A common set of sampling feature types is defined that is classified primarily by topological dimension,
as well as samples for ex-situ observations. The schema includes relationships between sampling features (sub-sampling, derived samples).
