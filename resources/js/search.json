In this recent third version more than 600 standards, as relevant for the soil- and agricultural research data management, are compiled, discussed and/or recommended. It is grouped based on three major data life stages and might act as a helpful reference work for the soil-agricultural research data community.","Data acquisition","Data management","Data provision","The use of open and widely accepted standards is the basis for modern ( FAIR, see Wilkinson et al., 2016) research data management. In this context, task of this report is to describe, compare, review and recommend standards for the whole data life and to assist soil- and agricultural scientists to store their research data into a data infrastructure to make them findable and accessible in the long-term for any reuse. Missing and competitive national and international standards and potential conflicts are stated and, based on internal and external expert knowledge, outstanding standards are highlighted and summarized to recommendations:","Favored = highly recommended for application OK = acceptable alternative but maybe requires later transformation","In the Appendix the highly recommended standards as well as many code lists, glossaries and web links are listed in tables"]},{"l":"The BonaRes data repository","p":["In July 2017, the BonaRes Data Centre launched a data repository for soil and agricultural research data and accompanying metadata. Beside data from national research projects, the repository is open for other soil-related data, e.g. from agricultural long-term field experiments (LTE). The BonaRes Data Centre provides DOI, easy access and long-term availability for all uploaded research data. According to the Berlin Declaration on Open Access (2003) and the initiative “Digitale Information” (Alliance of Science Organizations in Germany, 2013), metadata and research data will not be subject to any restrictions on reuse. Metadata are always available and, after a limited embargo-time, also research data are provided accessible for the international research community. Further information is given in the BonaRes Data Policy ( Svoboda 2021).","According to the GitHub FAIRMetrics, the BonaRes data repository serves all relevant elements of FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, see Wilkinson et al., 2016), and additionally, provides legal security for sensitive data and facilitate data up- and downloads. To meet these demands and to enhance research data reusability (FAIR Principle R 1.3), the use of relevant open community standards and data documentation during data life is necessary. Such standards concern, beside others, the classification and description of soils, field- and lab methods, agricultural technology, plant varieties, fertilizers, farming and agricultural business, data quality control, ontologies, data formats, data storage and -archiving, and metadata management. All standards which are recommended within this document are supported by the BonaRes repository. Research data which were collected under standardized conditions, described with coherent metadata, proofed by quality tests, and stored in the repository, will be visible, accessible and citable for any data reuse (e.g. modelling), exchange or review.","In the long term it is planned to consolidate the BonaRes repository into international infrastructures for soil and agricultural research data. This requires data interoperability by internationally accepted and applied standards. Transformation tools may help to translate data from national to international valid systems and formats."]}],[{"l":"1 Data Acquisition","p":["The acquisition of soil-, crop-, agricultural machinery-, farming-, business, and other, soil- and agricultural related research data are regulated by numerous, sometimes inconsistent, standards, laws, guidelines and conventions. Many regulations are used only in national contexts and may require transformation to be interoperable in international contexts.","In this chapter, standards in soil science from field and lab work (e.g. soil mapping, -classification, and-quality), meteorology, agriculture (e.g., crops, tillage tools, field management, and fertilization), business, and personal data (e.g., farm size, attitudes of farmers, income, and property rights) are collected, described and evaluated."]},{"i":"11-field-soil-description-and-soil-classification","l":"1.1 Field Soil Description and Soil Classification","p":["Overview of existing standards","German Soil Survey Guidelines(“Bodenkundliche Kartieranleitung”), 5th edition, Ad-hoc-AG Boden(2005, KA5), short: KA5"]}],[{"l":"German Soil Survey Guideline","p":["German Soil Survey Guidelines(“Bodenkundliche Kartieranleitung”), 5th edition, Ad-hoc-AG Boden(2005, KA5), short: KA5","The first edition (1965) was a nation-wide accepted guideline in administration and research. Still in use in some federal states are also the editions (KA4, 1994 and KA3, 1982). The administrative soil surveys of the federal states ( Bundesländer) often use adaptations and modifications of this guideline. A shortened and simplified version of the German Soil Survey Guidelines has been extracted from KA5 for soil conservation purposes ( Arbeitshilfe Boden; short: AHB); the Federal Soil Protection and Contaminated Sites Ordinance in Germany refers nonetheless to KA4.","The major part is about describing site, soil profile, layers and horizons, naming horizons and soil’s allocation in the German soil system (“Bodensystematik”) as well as a classification of the soil material(substrate classification; ”Substratsystematik”). A large number of parameters, often with partly extensive code lists, and a formalized way to record auxiliary information (form, degree of expression, share, and size) are provided. It is thus one of the most detailed guidelines for soil description in the world. However, a strict data model is not included.","A new edition is awaited (possibly in 2020) with improvements in the soil system and substrate classification, horizon notation, code lists and in the mapping part. The simplification of soil description(AHB) shall be included in the new edition."]}]]
