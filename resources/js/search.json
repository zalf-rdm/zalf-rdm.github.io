The third version is published in the BonaRes Series, 2020 with more than 600 standards, as relevant for the soil- and agricultural research data management. As the report is a living document, the report is transferred to this web application to compile, discuss and recommend the latest state of data standards for soil and agricultural research.","It is grouped based on three major data life stages and might act as a helpful reference work for the soil-agricultural research data community.","Data acquisition","Data management","Data provision"]},{"l":"Motivation","p":["The use of open and widely accepted standards is the basis for modern (FAIR,[1]) research data management. In this context, task of this report is to describe, compare, review and recommend standards for the whole data life and to assist soil- and agricultural scientists to store their research data into a data infrastructure to make them findable and accessible in the long-term for any reuse. Missing and competitive national and international standards and potential conflicts are stated and, based on internal and external expert knowledge, outstanding standards are highlighted and summarized to recommendations:","Favored = highly recommended for application OK = acceptable alternative but maybe requires later transformation","In the Appendix the highly recommended standards as well as many code lists, glossaries and web links are listed in tables"]},{"l":"The BonaRes Repository","p":["In July 2017, the BonaRes Centre launched the BonaRes Repository for soil and agricultural research data. Beside data from national research projects, the repository is open for other soil-related data, e.g. from agricultural long-term field experiments (LTE). The BonaRes Centre provides DOI, easy access and long-term availability for all uploaded research data. According to the Berlin Declaration on Open Access (2003) and the initiative“Digitale Information” ( Alliance of Science Organizations in Germany, 2013), metadata and research data will not be subject to any restrictions on reuse. Metadata are always available and, after a limited embargo-time, also research data are provided accessible for the international research community. Further information is given in the BonaRes Data Policy [2].","According to the GitHub FAIRMetrics, the BonaRes Repository serves all relevant elements of FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, see [1]), and additionally, provides legal security for sensitive data and facilitate data up- and downloads. To meet these demands and to enhance research data reusability (FAIR Principle R 1.3), the use of relevant open community standards and data documentation during data life is necessary. Such standards concern, beside others, the classification and description of soils, field- and lab methods, agricultural technology, plant varieties, fertilizers, farming and agricultural business, data quality control, ontologies, data formats, data storage and -archiving, and metadata management. All standards which are recommended within this document are supported by the BonaRes repository. Research data which were collected under standardized conditions, described with coherent metadata, proofed by quality tests, and stored in the repository, will be visible, accessible and citable for any data reuse (e.g. modelling), exchange or review.","In the long term it is planned to consolidate the BonaRes Repository into international infrastructures for soil and agricultural research data. This requires data interoperability by internationally accepted and applied standards. Transformation tools may help to translate data from national to international valid systems and formats.","[1] Wilkinson, M., Dumontier, M., Aalbersberg, I. et al.

Many regulations are used only in national contexts and may require transformation to be interoperable in international contexts.","In this chapter, standards in soil science from field and lab work (e.g. soil mapping, -classification, and-quality), meteorology, agriculture (e.g., crops, tillage tools, field management, and fertilization), business, and personal data (e.g., farm size, attitudes of farmers, income, and property rights) are collected, described and evaluated.","Data acquisition Data acquisition"]}],[{"l":"Field Soil Description and Soil Classification"},{"l":"Overview of existing standards"},{"l":"German Soil Survey Guidelines","p":["German Soil Survey Guidelines (“Bodenkundliche Kartieranleitung”), 5th edition, Ad-hoc-AG Boden (2005, KA5), short: KA5","The first edition (1965) was a nation-wide accepted guideline in administration and research. Still in use in some federal states are also the editions (KA4, 1994 and KA3, 1982). The administrative soil surveys of the federal states ( Bundesländer) often use adaptations and modifications of this guideline. A shortened and simplified version of the German Soil Survey Guidelines has been extracted from KA5 for soil conservation purposes (Arbeitshilfe Boden; short: AHB); the Federal Soil Protection and Contaminated Sites Ordinance in Germany refers nonetheless to KA4.","The major part is about describing site, soil profile, layers and horizons, naming horizons and soil’s allocation in the German soil system (“Bodensystematik”) as well as a classification of the soil material (substrate classification;”Substratsystematik”). A large number of parameters, often with partly extensive code lists, and a formalized way to record auxiliary information (form, degree of expression, share, and size) are provided. It is thus one of the most detailed guidelines for soil description in the world. However, a strict data model is not included.","A new edition is awaited (possibly in 2020) with improvements in the soil system and substrate classification, horizon notation, code lists and in the mapping part. The simplification of soil description (AHB) shall be included in the new edition."]},{"l":"World Reference Base for Soil Resources","p":["WRB, IUSS Working Group (2014). World reference base for soil resources 2014: International soil classification system for naming soils and creating legends for soil maps: Update 2015. World Soil Resources Reports No. 106: 203.","The WRB was developed by a working group with the participation of IUSS, FAO, and ISRIC. It provides a standard taxonomic soil classification system which allows the accommodation of national systems. It is designed to serve as a common denominator for communication at the international level and as a correlation between existing classification systems. The WRB classification system contains two hierarchical levels: On the level of “Reference Soil Group” (RSG) 32 units are differentiated. On the second level the RSG is described more precisely by the use of “Qualifiers”. For every RSG a list with corresponding principal and supplementary Qualifiers is defined. Classification is done by using both levels via diagnostic horizons, materials and features."]},{"i":"conflicts-and-solutions-transformation-and-derivation-tools","l":"Conflicts and solutions (transformation and derivation tools)"},{"l":"National","p":["The Soil Survey Guidelines in its 5th edition (KA5) is currently the valid basis for soil description in Germany. However, some administrative soil surveys of the federal states use modifications of these guidelines. Even prior editions of 1994 (KA4) and 1982 (KA3) are still applied. Harmonization of data acquired according to different editions of KA can be realized by the use of a transformation tool developed by the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources BGR (see Chapter 0). DIN 4220 is based on KA5, but deviates in some detail and in particular regarding some site assessment parameters. DIN 4220 is often applied in the context of geotechnical investigation. KA5 has a more expanded scope of application and community of users than DIN 4220. Thus, DIN 4220 as a national standard for soil description in the field has less importance than the German Soil Survey Guidelines.","The substrate classification of soil assessment deviates clearly from that given in the German Soil Survey Guidelines. Mineral soil types are determined by the fractions of sand, loam and clay. Silt is not represented as a grain fraction, contrary to other established substrate classification systems, so that comparison with other soil data is difficult. However, soil assessment data are valuable for various soil scientific issues regarding their high spatial resolution ( scale 1:5000) and comprehensive availability for agricultural area (see Transformation tool for Soil Assessment data, Chapter 2.3).","The German version of ISO 25177 is not intended to compete with the German Soil Survey Guidelines or with its deducted standards (e.g. DIN 4220) nor to replace them. It rather should facilitate soil survey work abroad, especially in Europe. In principle, soil description is feasible according to ISO 25177 also for soils occurring in Germany. But for most national purposes the application of the German Soil Survey Guidelines is recommended or even mandatory, according to national law."]},{"l":"International","p":["There are significant differences between WRB and German soil classification. Main criteria for the latter are type and vertical order of genetic horizons in soil profiles. In contrast the WRB system uses diagnostic horizons, features and materials that are described independently from each other. The WRB nomenclature of soil types is based on 32 Reference Soil Groups (RSG) with principal and supplementary qualifiers. A simple translation of the German soil name into the WRB name is not feasible for a wide range of soil types due to the deviant approaches. Moreover, WRB uses analytical parameters for classification, which are either not available for many soil profiles in Germany or are analyzed with different methods than those intended by WRB."]}],[{"l":"Soil Sampling"},{"l":"Overview of existing standards"},{"i":"globalsoilmap-sampling-depths","l":"GlobalSoilMap (Sampling depths)","p":["The GlobalSoilMap initiative of the Digital Soil Mapping Working Group, International Union of Soil Science (IUSS), supports generating and providing standardized soil data for the world.

ISO 18400 is currently in development and has, in contrast to its precursor, a modular structure. Examples are the framework for a sampling plan (ISO 18400-101:2015), safety aspects (ISO 18400-103:2015) and quality control/assurance (ISO 18400-106:2015)."]}],[{"l":"Plant Sampling"}],[{"l":"Data management","p":["The topic data management includes methodical standards to structure and quality assure research data as recorded by standardized methods. Quality by supervised or unsupervised procedures e.g. data completeness, normal distribution, integrity, and removal of outliers, is prerequisite for wellmaintained data storage, -exchange, -processing and-evaluation. Descriptive data should be checked on misspellings, synonyms and inconsistencies to enable clear data allocation and combination of different data sets.","When research data are collected, tested, described, and maybe pre-processed (e.g. pedotransferfunctions, biological models, upscaling) data must be technically prepared to be transferred into the database. At this point internal database management becomes relevant. Data (base) management includes e.g. rules on the data structure, languages and formats used. These need to meet the requirements on later data applications such as archiving, evaluation, reuse, and publishing. Research data management is widely implemented within research institutes in so-called Current Research Information Systems (CRIS) and in national or international (inter-)disciplinary data repositories. An example for national agricultural data management is the PIAF system (Planning, Information and Analysis for Field trials). An international and interdisciplinary open data repository for the wide field of environmental science is the PANGAEA.","Internationally accepted Data Management Plans (DMP) and open research data portals may help to plan, manage and publish research data. Tools and guidelines are provided by open access platforms and repositories such as ReDBox (Australia), OpenAIRE, CGIAR, EUDAT, EOSC, and INSPIRE.","This chapter provides an overview of standards with general requirements on data quality, -structure -formats, and–types as well as geographic reference systems, units and dimensions."]}],[{"l":"General Conventions","p":["This chapter summarize general data conventions which should be considered during the data collection and preparation."]},{"l":"Overview of existing standards","p":["In Table 6 (following page) an overview lists recommended standards with general and geographic data conventions and requirements e.g. on geographic reference systems, units and dimensions."]}],[{"l":"Data Quality and Statistics"}],[{"l":"Data Provision","p":["Structured research data, reasonably described by standardized metadata facilitates its provision and increase its visibility.
