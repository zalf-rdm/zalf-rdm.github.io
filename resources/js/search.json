In this context, task of this report is to describe, compare, review and recommend standards for the whole data life and to assist soil- and agricultural scientists to store their research data into a data infrastructure to make them findable and accessible in the long-term for any reuse. Missing and competitive national and international standards and potential conflicts are stated and, based on internal and external expert knowledge, outstanding standards are highlighted and summarized to recommendations:","Favored = highly recommended for application OK = acceptable alternative but maybe requires later transformation","In the Appendix the highly recommended standards as well as many code lists, glossaries and web links are listed in tables"]},{"l":"The BonaRes Repository","p":["In July 2017, the BonaRes Centre launched the BonaRes Repository for soil and agricultural research data. Beside data from national research projects, the repository is open for other soil-related data, e.g. from agricultural long-term field experiments (LTE). The BonaRes Centre provides DOI, easy access and long-term availability for all uploaded research data. According to the Berlin Declaration on Open Access (2003)[2] and the initiative“Digitale Information”[3], metadata and research data will not be subject to any restrictions on reuse. Metadata are always available and, after a limited embargo-time, also research data are provided accessible for the international research community. Further information is given in the BonaRes Data Guideline [4].","According to the GitHub FAIRMetrics, the BonaRes Repository serves all relevant elements of FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, see [1]), and additionally, provides legal security for sensitive data and facilitate data up- and downloads. To meet these demands and to enhance research data reusability (FAIR Principle R 1.3), the use of relevant open community standards and data documentation during data life is necessary. Such standards concern, beside others, the classification and description of soils, field- and lab methods, agricultural technology, plant varieties, fertilizers, farming and agricultural business, data quality control, ontologies, data formats, data storage and -archiving, and metadata management. All standards which are recommended within this document are supported by the BonaRes repository. Research data which were collected under standardized conditions, described with coherent metadata, proofed by quality tests, and stored in the repository, will be visible, accessible and citable for any data reuse (e.g. modelling), exchange or review.","In the long term it is planned to consolidate the BonaRes Repository into international infrastructures for soil and agricultural research data. This requires data interoperability by internationally accepted and applied standards. Transformation tools may help to translate data from national to international valid systems and formats.","[1] Wilkinson, M., Dumontier, M., Aalbersberg, I. et al.

Still in use in some federal states are also the editions (KA4, 1994 and KA3, 1982). The administrative soil surveys of the federal states ( Bundesländer) often use adaptations and modifications of this guideline. A shortened and simplified version of the German Soil Survey Guidelines has been extracted from KA5 [1] for soil conservation purposes (Arbeitshilfe Boden; short: AHB); the Federal Soil Protection and Contaminated Sites Ordinance in Germany refers nonetheless to KA4.","The major part is about describing site, soil profile, layers and horizons, naming horizons and soil’s allocation in the German soil system (“Bodensystematik”) as well as a classification of the soil material (substrate classification;”Substratsystematik”). A large number of parameters, often with partly extensive code lists, and a formalized way to record auxiliary information (form, degree of expression, share, and size) are provided. It is thus one of the most detailed guidelines for soil description in the world. However, a strict data model is not included.","A new edition is awaited (“KA6”, possibly in 2023) with improvements in the soil system and substrate classification, horizon notation, code lists and in the mapping part.

It provides a standard taxonomic soil classification system which allows the accommodation of national systems. It is designed to serve as a common denominator for communication at the international level and as a correlation between existing classification systems. The WRB classification system contains two hierarchical levels: On the level of “Reference Soil Group” (RSG) 32 units are differentiated. On the second level the RSG is described more precisely by the use of “Qualifiers”. For every RSG a list with corresponding principal and supplementary Qualifiers is defined. Classification is done by using both levels via diagnostic horizons, materials and features."]},{"l":"DIN 19682-1ff"},{"i":"soil-quality---field-investigation","l":"Soil Quality - Field Investigation","p":["The DIN 19682 series describes in 9 parts determination and measurement techniques for soil properties which are applicable in the field.

The other parts contain analytical methods for field-measurements of the following parameters: water infiltration rate (7), water and air permeability (8 & 9), carbonates, sulfides, pH-value and iron(II)-ions (13).

Soil mapping according to these guidelines is required by law and organized by the German fiscal authorities. Mapping is realized by the description of soil profiles with 1 m depth at intervals of 50 m, resulting in large scale soil information. The guidelines provide a soil taxation framework for field assessments (“Bewertungsrahmen”) which combines soil type, soil condition/development and the parent material of which the soil is composed. Soil investigation which is following this standard, results in a soil value (“Bodenwertzahl”).

However, some administrative soil surveys of the federal states use modifications of these guidelines. Even prior editions of 1994 (KA4) and 1982 (KA3) are still applied. Harmonization of data acquired according to different editions of KA can be realized by the use of a transformation tool developed by the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources BGR (see Chapter Data Standards for Soil- and Agricultural Research). DIN 4220 is based on KA5, but deviates in some detail and in particular regarding some site assessment parameters. DIN 4220 is often applied in the context of geotechnical investigation. KA5 has a more expanded scope of application and community of users than DIN 4220. Thus, DIN 4220 as a national standard for soil description in the field has less importance than the German Soil Survey Guidelines.","The substrate classification of soil assessment deviates clearly from that given in the German Soil Survey Guidelines. Mineral soil types are determined by the fractions of sand, loam and clay. Silt is not represented as a grain fraction, contrary to other established substrate classification systems, so that comparison with other soil data is difficult. However, soil assessment data are valuable for various soil scientific issues regarding their high spatial resolution ( scale 1:5000) and comprehensive availability for agricultural area (see Transformation tool for Soil Assessment data, Chapter 2.3).","The German version of ISO 25177 is not intended to compete with the German Soil Survey Guidelines or with its deducted standards (e.g. DIN 4220) nor to replace them. It rather should facilitate soil survey work abroad, especially in Europe. In principle, soil description is feasible according to ISO 25177 also for soils occurring in Germany. But for most national purposes the application of the German Soil Survey Guidelines is recommended or even mandatory, according to national law.","Table 1: Selected national standards in the field of soil description and classification"]},{"l":"International","p":["There are significant differences between WRB and German soil classification. Main criteria for the latter are type and vertical order of genetic horizons in soil profiles. In contrast, the WRB system uses diagnostic horizons, features and materials that are described independently from each other. The WRB nomenclature of soil types is based on 32 Reference Soil Groups (RSG) with principal and supplementary qualifiers. A simple translation of the German soil name into the WRB name is not feasible for a wide range of soil types due to the deviant approaches. Moreover, WRB uses analytical parameters for classification, which are either not available for many soil profiles in Germany or are analyzed with different methods than those intended by WRB.","[1] Boden, Ad-hoc-AG (2005).
