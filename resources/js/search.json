According to the Berlin Declaration on Open Access (2003) and the initiative“Digitale Information” ( Alliance of Science Organizations in Germany, 2013), metadata and research data will not be subject to any restrictions on reuse. Metadata are always available and, after a limited embargo-time, also research data are provided accessible for the international research community. Further information is given in the BonaRes Data Policy [2].","According to the GitHub FAIRMetrics, the BonaRes Repository serves all relevant elements of FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, see [1]), and additionally, provides legal security for sensitive data and facilitate data up- and downloads. To meet these demands and to enhance research data reusability (FAIR Principle R 1.3), the use of relevant open community standards and data documentation during data life is necessary. Such standards concern, beside others, the classification and description of soils, field- and lab methods, agricultural technology, plant varieties, fertilizers, farming and agricultural business, data quality control, ontologies, data formats, data storage and -archiving, and metadata management. All standards which are recommended within this document are supported by the BonaRes repository. Research data which were collected under standardized conditions, described with coherent metadata, proofed by quality tests, and stored in the repository, will be visible, accessible and citable for any data reuse (e.g. modelling), exchange or review.","In the long term it is planned to consolidate the BonaRes Repository into international infrastructures for soil and agricultural research data.

The administrative soil surveys of the federal states ( Bundesländer) often use adaptations and modifications of this guideline. A shortened and simplified version of the German Soil Survey Guidelines has been extracted from KA5 for soil conservation purposes (Arbeitshilfe Boden; short: AHB); the Federal Soil Protection and Contaminated Sites Ordinance in Germany refers nonetheless to KA4.","The major part is about describing site, soil profile, layers and horizons, naming horizons and soil’s allocation in the German soil system (“Bodensystematik”) as well as a classification of the soil material (substrate classification;”Substratsystematik”). A large number of parameters, often with partly extensive code lists, and a formalized way to record auxiliary information (form, degree of expression, share, and size) are provided.

The WRB classification system contains two hierarchical levels: On the level of “Reference Soil Group” (RSG) 32 units are differentiated. On the second level the RSG is described more precisely by the use of “Qualifiers”. For every RSG a list with corresponding principal and supplementary Qualifiers is defined.

However, some administrative soil surveys of the federal states use modifications of these guidelines. Even prior editions of 1994 (KA4) and 1982 (KA3) are still applied. Harmonization of data acquired according to different editions of KA can be realized by the use of a transformation tool developed by the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources BGR (see Chapter 0). DIN 4220 is based on KA5, but deviates in some detail and in particular regarding some site assessment parameters. DIN 4220 is often applied in the context of geotechnical investigation. KA5 has a more expanded scope of application and community of users than DIN 4220. Thus, DIN 4220 as a national standard for soil description in the field has less importance than the German Soil Survey Guidelines.","The substrate classification of soil assessment deviates clearly from that given in the German Soil Survey Guidelines. Mineral soil types are determined by the fractions of sand, loam and clay. Silt is not represented as a grain fraction, contrary to other established substrate classification systems, so that comparison with other soil data is difficult. However, soil assessment data are valuable for various soil scientific issues regarding their high spatial resolution ( scale 1:5000) and comprehensive availability for agricultural area (see Transformation tool for Soil Assessment data, Chapter 2.3).","The German version of ISO 25177 is not intended to compete with the German Soil Survey Guidelines or with its deducted standards (e.g. DIN 4220) nor to replace them. It rather should facilitate soil survey work abroad, especially in Europe. In principle, soil description is feasible according to ISO 25177 also for soils occurring in Germany.

A simple translation of the German soil name into the WRB name is not feasible for a wide range of soil types due to the deviant approaches.
