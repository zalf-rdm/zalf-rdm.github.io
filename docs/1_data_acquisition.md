# 1 Data Acquisition

The acquisition of soil-, crop-, agricultural machinery-, farming-, business, and other, soil- and
agricultural related research data are regulated by numerous, sometimes inconsistent, standards,
laws, guidelines and conventions. Many regulations are used only in national contexts and may require
transformation to be interoperable in international contexts.

In this chapter, standards in soil science from field and lab work (e.g. soil mapping, -classification, and
-quality), meteorology, agriculture (e.g., crops, tillage tools, field management, and fertilization),
business, and personal data (e.g., farm size, attitudes of farmers, income, and property rights) are
collected, described and evaluated.

## 1.1 Field Soil Description and Soil Classification

_Overview of existing standards_

**German Soil Survey Guidelines** (“Bodenkundliche Kartieranleitung”), 5th edition, Ad-hoc-AG Boden
(2005, KA5), short: KA5 <img src="img/two_star.jpg" width="60" valign="bottom" > 

The first edition (1965) was a nation-wide accepted guideline in administration and research. Still in
use in some federal states are also the editions (KA4, 1994 and KA3, 1982). The administrative soil
surveys of the federal states (_Bundesländer_) often use adaptations and modifications of this guideline.
A shortened and simplified version of the German Soil Survey Guidelines has been extracted from KA5
for soil conservation purposes (_Arbeitshilfe Boden_; short: AHB); the Federal Soil Protection and
Contaminated Sites Ordinance in Germany refers nonetheless to KA4.

The major part is about describing site, soil profile, layers and horizons, naming horizons and soil’s
allocation in the German soil system (_“Bodensystematik”_) as well as a classification of the soil material
(substrate classification; _”Substratsystematik”_). A large number of parameters, often with partly
extensive code lists, and a formalized way to record auxiliary information (form, degree of expression,
share, and size) are provided. It is thus one of the most detailed guidelines for soil description in the
world. However, a strict data model is not included.

A new edition is awaited (possibly in 2020) with improvements in the soil system and substrate
classification, horizon notation, code lists and in the mapping part. The simplification of soil description
(AHB) shall be included in the new edition.
